# findDouble
C++ programming language test
Task to do is:

Given is a vector of integers. The function findDouble(vector<int> values) should find all members of vector wich have double values in the vector. If there is many members with double values then that member should not be counted. Members should be pushed to the terminal (stdout) sorted in ascending order.

For example:
for vector<int> values = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,8] the result is 0 1 2 3 because 2x0 = 0, 2x1=2, 2x2=4 and 2x3=6 

Altough 2x4=8 4 is not counted because there is 2 member of vector with value of 8.
